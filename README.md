###Project Advanced Topics in Autonomous Agents

This is the code used to do the experiments in the report.

`cliff.py` has the code to run GP-CEPS

Example: `python cliff.py`

`cliff-evolution.py` contains the code for pure evolutionary programming

`cliff-coevolution.py` has the code for the co-evolutionary approach.

In the folder `eonn/`, there is a mix of code by Rogier Koppenjan and us. We changed the files `eonn.py`, `genome.py` and `network.py`.

In `genome.py` we added two classes to be able to evolve z. In eonn and network we made small edits to for example limit the stepsize and other things that are (toy) problem specific.
