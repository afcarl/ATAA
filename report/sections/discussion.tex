% Ideas: (no order)
% hack
% gp uncertainty issue
% finding best, after gp is found issue
% toy problem issue: uniformly taken (do we want that?)
% dimensionality of policy issue gp
% limited applicability in problems with high dimensionality of z
% kernel gaussian process, in general params GP general
% co-evolution worked well (validated...?)
% issue generalizing over strict border between good and bad policies 
% tweaking is hard as many aspects of the approach are sort of black-box
