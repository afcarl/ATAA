% co-evolution works 
Firstly, Co-evolving $z$ with $\pi$ clearly leads to a lower sample complexity than baseline evolutionary policy search. 

Further, the proposed method GP CEPS is non-trivial as it requires some requires some problem-specific engineering in a hard to track process. Further investigations in the shape of the development of the Gaussian Posterior over time and the shape of the true fitness landscape can aid designing a suitable GP and, subsequently, aqcuisition functions. Furthermore, theoretical guarantees might aid development of successful GP CEPS methods by provising insight in the number of samples necessary to achieve a certain result.

% GP is non-trivial implementation

% GP did not meet expectations, possible causes explained in discussion

\subsection{Further research}
% theoretical bounds more insights
