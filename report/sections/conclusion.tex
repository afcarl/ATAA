Firstly, Co-evolving $z$ with $\pi$ clearly leads to a lower sample complexity than baseline evolutionary policy search. This indicates that co-evolution approach towards policy search, as proposed by Dr. White, is promising and should be further examined.

Furthermore, the proposed method GP CEPS is non-trivial as it requires some problem-specific engineering in a hard to track process. Further investigations in the shape of the development of the Gaussian Posterior over time and the shape of the true fitness landscape can aid designing a suitable GP and, subsequently, aqcuisition functions. 

\subsection{Further research}
First, it would be interesting to research the performance of the GP CESP on a different problem, to test whether a non-linearity in the reward structure explains its uncertainty. Second, as the Gaussian Process depends on multiple parameters and a choice of kernel, further tweaking could potentially lead to better performance. Lastly, theoretical guarantees might aid development of successful GP CEPS methods by providing insight in the parameter settings, acquisition function and the number of samples necessary to achieve a certain result.
