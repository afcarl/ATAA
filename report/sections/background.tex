% intro
In this section a background is given on the theory used in order to implement Bayesian co-evolution. It is divided into four parts, namely rare controllable events, neural networks, gaussian processes and (co)evolution. 

\subsection{Controllable rare events}
%Kern is goed, maar moet wat strakker geformuleerd worden. Eventueel terminologie uit de presentatie gebruiken? 
% Dit nu goed (ik nam aan dat met presentatie de proposal was bedoeld)??
Figure \ref{rareControllableImage} illustrates the concept of controllable rare events with two policies. Rare events are those of which the chance of occurring is very small (left on the x-axis), while an event is controllable when the choice of policy affects the performance greatly (the difference on y-axis of the policies per event). A controllable rare event is thus an event of which the probability of occurring is low while the chosen action significantly influences the reward.

\end{figure}

Coping properly with events that are both rare and controllable is vital because these events influence the performance of policies while difficult to discover: general approaches tend to ignore rare events. By explicitly focussing on controllable rare events, policies with seemingly equal performance are properly distinguished and the learning process accelerates.

\subsection{Neural Networks}
% meer in detail propagation uitleggen?
Neural networks are inspired by the central nervous systems and describe a set of nodes of which the (one-directional) connection contain weights. Nodes can be of three types: input-, output- or hidden nodes. The input nodes receive a signal (value), which are propagated to the next layer of nodes by multiplication with the corresponding weights. The values are propagated through the network and eventually reach the output nodes, which defines the output of the network. 

In the current setting, networks are used as policies. The current situation (state) is the input, whereas the output of the network is the action to take. Thus the neural network attempts to learn a function that maps states to a certain step.

\subsection{Gaussian Process}
% TODO

GP is used to maintain a believe over the fitness of policies and evolution is used as a means to do policy search.

\subsection{(Co) evolution}
% Evolution
Evolutionary algorithms aim to produce new entities based on a population and is inspired by biological evolution. Given a set of organisms, offspring is born by applying crossover and mutation operators: by combining the genes of the parents the new individuals exhibit similar, but slightly different, features. The selection of parents is based on an evaluation of the original set of organisms, and the better performing offspring replaces the least suited parents.

% evolution in our perspective
In the process of creating a better believe of the fitness over the policies, a method is required to define new policies.
