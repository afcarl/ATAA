Controllable rare-events are events that occur infrequently, but the agent could influence the effect on the performance that the event has. This means that some policies perform better than others in these events, making these events critical to distinguish between policies. In most applications of Reinforcement Learning it is easy to find a policy that works $99\%$ of the time [49,50 van shimons proposal]. However to make construct a policy that works in all cases is a lot harder. To alleviate this problem our proposal focuses on these controllable rare events and attemps to search for a policy that is performs well in these situations. This done using a co-evolutionary approach ...
