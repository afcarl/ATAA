\subsection{Evolutionary Policy Search}

First, we ran evolutionary policy search on the Toy Problem discussed in Section 4.4 with an MLP Policy with 4 hidden units. We used the evolutionary parameters as detailed in Section 4.2. Figure \ref{Fitness during Evolutionary Algorithm} shows the fitness of the best policy in the pool over the number of epochs. This was averaged over ten runs and 95\% confidence intervals are shown.

Figure \ref{Example policy learned with evolutionary algorithm} shows the performance of an example policy found with the evolutionary policy search algorithm, after 200 epochs. The wind is sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.5. Note that for all wind strengths, this policy reaches the goal.

\subsection{Co-Evolutionary Policy Search}

The results for Co-Evolutionary Policy Search are shown in Figure \ref{Fitness during Co-Evolutionary Algorithm}.

Once again, an MLP with 4 hidden units was trained, and the same general evolutionary parameters from Section 4.2 were used. An example policy trained with Co-Evolutionary Policy Search for 200 epochs is visualized in Figure \ref{Example policy learned with Co-Evolutionary algorithm}. This policy too is able to reach the goal for any wind strength.
