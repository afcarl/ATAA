\subsection{Evolutionary Policy Search}

First, we ran evolutionary policy search on the Toy Problem discussed in Section 4.4 with an MLP Policy with 4 hidden units. We used the evolutionary parameters as detailed in Section 4.2. Figure (...) shows the fitness of the best policy in the pool over the number of epochs. This was averaged over ten runs and 95\% confidence intervals are shown.

(...) shows the performance of an example policy found with the evolutionary policy search algorithm. 

\subsection{Co-Evolutionary Policy Search}

The results for Co-Evolutionary Policy Search are shown in (...). Once again, an MLP with 4 hidden units was trained. An example policy trained with Co-Evolutionary Policy Search is shown visualized in (...).
