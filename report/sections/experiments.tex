\subsection{Evolutionary Policy Search}

(...) shows the returns over the number of epochs for evolutionary policy search on the Toy Problem discussed in Section 4.4 with an MLP Policy with 4 hidden units, using the evolutionary parameters as detailed in Section 4.2. Returns are averaged across ten runs and 95\% confidence intervals are shown.


(...) shows the performance of an example policy found with the evolutionary policy search algorithm.
